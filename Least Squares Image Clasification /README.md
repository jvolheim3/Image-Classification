# Least Squares Regression Image Clasification

## Introduction
This project uses the concept of least squares to perform the supervised classification of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. We will be implementing both binary classifiers and multi-classifiers from their basic least squares principals to perform this task. We will be implementing this project in Python and will be using data from a MNIST database which contains gray-scale images of handwritten numbers with image sizes of 28 x 28 pixels.

    - Least Squares Theory (Part 1)
    
    - Least Squares Classifiers (Part 2)
    
    - Randomized Feature-Based LS Classifiers (Part 3)

## Summary
    Based on the results and theories derived from this project, it is clear that the application of least squares-based classifiers is considered accurate at determining the label of a handwritten digit with only a 4.7% error. This was an important project because it gave a deeper understanding of the least squares application and its limitations.
